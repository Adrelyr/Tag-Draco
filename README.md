# **TagDraco : Simple MP3 metadata editing tool**
Version 1.0.0
This simple tool was made for all people wanting to easily change their mp3 metadata.
Although Windows can do such a thing, it does not allow you to change the Album cover :)

Using TagLib-Sharp from https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp

Roadmap :

 - Adding support for editing multiple files at a time
 - Better memory management (i still need to learn how to manage it correctly)

*The look is subject to change, but here's how it looks like currently*
